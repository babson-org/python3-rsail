# suppose we had a list of n elements. create a new list that

    myList = ['apple', 'orange', 'pear', 'blueberry', 'peach']
      shifted_list = ['pear', 'blueberry', 'peach', 'apple', 'orange']

        Hints:
             1) use len(), %, enumerate
                  2) also assign shifted_list = [None] * length  (you'll need to determine 
                          the length variable)
                               3) shift inside the for loop
                                    4) print out the printed list outside the for loop
